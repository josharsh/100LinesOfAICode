### Tweet 2 (AI Agent)
```
1/ 🤖 Autonomous AI Agent (95 lines)

Give it a task in English:
"find all TODO comments and summarize them"

It:
- Plans multi-step solutions
- Uses tools (file I/O, code exec)
- Self-corrects errors
- Works completely autonomously

### Tweet 3 (MCP Server)
```
2/ 🔌 MCP Server (87 lines)

Anthropic's BRAND NEW protocol (late 2024).

Connect AI to ANY data source:
- Your files
- Your database
- Your APIs

Pure Python. Zero frameworks.

This is the future of AI integration.
```

### Tweet 4 (Code Reviewer)
```
3/ 👁️ AI Code Reviewer (99 lines)

Get instant expert reviews:

python reviewer.py --file mycode.py

Checks:
- 🐛 Bugs & edge cases
- 🔒 Security vulnerabilities
- ⚡ Performance issues
- 📚 Best practices

Better than waiting for PR reviews!
```

### Tweet 5 (RAG)
```
4/ 📚 Mini RAG (94 lines)

Chat with YOUR documents.

No vector databases.
No complicated setup.
Just: index docs → ask questions

Perfect for:
- Documentation chatbots
- Personal knowledge base
- Research assistants

```

### Tweet 6 (Commit AI)
```
5/ 💬 Commit AI (76 lines)

Never write commit messages again.

git add .
python commit.py --commit

✅ Analyzes your changes
✅ Follows Conventional Commits
✅ Learns your style
✅ One-line git integration

I'll never manually write commits again.
```

### Tweet 7 (Voice/Terminal)
```
6/ 🎤 Voice to Code (94 lines)
⚡ Terminal AI (88 lines)

SPEAK your requirements → get working code
TYPE in plain English → get safe shell commands

The future of programming is conversational.

🚀 The Power of Minimal Code: 7 AI Tools in <100 Lines Each

I just open-sourced a collection that challenges conventional wisdom: you don't need thousands of lines to build production-ready AI tools.

What's inside:
• Autonomous AI Agent (95 lines) - executes tasks without human intervention
• Model Context Protocol Server (87 lines) - Anthropic's latest protocol
• AI Code Reviewer (99 lines) - instant expert-level code reviews
• Mini RAG System (94 lines) - document Q&A without vector databases
• 3 more practical tools

Why this matters for developers:
1. Learning: Understand AI systems without framework complexity
2. Production: These tools solve real problems despite being minimal
3. Education: Perfect for teaching AI fundamentals

Each tool includes comprehensive documentation, real-world examples, and follows software best practices.

The project demonstrates that constraint breeds creativity. By limiting ourselves to 100 lines per tool, we're forced to focus on what truly matters.

Tech stack: Python, Claude API, minimal dependencies

### Comment (post as first comment)
```
Hey HN! Author here.

I built this collection to prove a point: you don't need LangChain, AutoGPT, or thousands of lines to build useful AI tools.

Each tool is:
- ≤100 lines (excluding blanks/comments)
- Production-ready with error handling
- Well-documented with examples
- Educational - you can read the entire codebase

Highlights:
• Autonomous AI Agent - give it tasks in English, it plans and executes
• MCP Server - implements Anthropic's new Model Context Protocol
• Code Reviewer - AI-powered PR reviews
• Mini RAG - document Q&A without vector databases
• Plus commit message generator, voice-to-code, and terminal AI

Tech: Python 3.8+, Claude API, minimal dependencies (numpy, anthropic SDK)

The 100-line constraint forced me to think carefully about what's essential. No bloat, no over-engineering, just focused tools that work.

I'm here to answer questions! What would you build in 100 lines?

### r/MachineLearning
**Title:** `[P] 7 AI Tools, None Over 100 Lines – Minimal Implementations`

```
I built a collection of minimal AI tools to demonstrate that you don't need complex frameworks for production-ready AI applications.

Project: https://github.com/josharsh/100LinesOfAICode

Each tool is ≤100 lines and includes:

Tier S (2025 Trends):
- Autonomous AI Agent (95 lines) - tool use, self-correction
- MCP Server (87 lines) - Anthropic's new protocol
- AI Code Reviewer (99 lines) - instant code reviews

Tier A (High Utility):
- Mini RAG (94 lines) - document Q&A, no vector DB
- Commit AI (76 lines) - auto-generate git messages
- Voice to Code (94 lines) - speech → working code
- Terminal AI (88 lines) - natural language → safe shell commands

All tools are production-ready with error handling, type hints, and comprehensive docs.

The constraint forced creative solutions - e.g., the RAG system uses simple word-frequency embeddings instead of OpenAI's API.

Feedback welcome! What other minimal AI tools would be useful?
```

### r/Python
**Title:** `Collection of AI Tools in Python - Each Under 100 Lines`
