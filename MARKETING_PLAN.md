## 📱 Content Marketing Strategy

### Phase 1: Viral Content Creation (Weeks 1-4)

#### 🔥 High-Engagement Content Ideas

**1. "Roast My Commits" Twitter Thread**
```
🔥 I built an AI that roasts your commit messages in 55 lines of Python

Here's what it said about MY commits:

1. "asdf" 
   → Did your cat walk on the keyboard?

2. "fix stuff"
   → Wow. Such detail. Very helpful.

3. "final FINAL v3"
   → Commitment issues much?

Link in bio to roast your own commits 👇
```

**2. "Kind Blame" Meme Thread**
```
Normal git blame: 😤 "WHO WROTE THIS GARBAGE"

Kind Blame AI: ☕ "Looks like someone was having a creative day! We've all been there."

Built it in 70 lines. Thread 🧵
```

**3. "LangChain vs 100 Lines" Comparison Posts**
```
LangChain RAG example: 300+ lines
100LinesOfAICode RAG: 94 lines

Both do the same thing.

One you can read in a coffee break. ☕

[Side-by-side code comparison image]
```

**4. Video Content: "Speed Runs"**
- "I built an AI commit writer in 5 minutes" (terminal recording)
- "Watch me understand an entire AI tool" (reading 100 lines)
- "LangChain uninstall → 100 lines install" (tongue-in-cheek)

### Content Calendar

| Week | Platform | Content Type | Tool Featured |
|------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | Twitter | Thread + GIF | Commit Roaster |
| 1 | Reddit | r/programming | Philosophy post |
| 2 | HN | Show HN | Launch post |
| 2 | Dev.to | Tutorial | Week Recap |
| 3 | YouTube | Demo video | Kind Blame |
| 3 | Twitter | Meme thread | Rubber Duck |
| 4 | LinkedIn | Professional | PR Writer |
| 4 | Product Hunt | Launch | Full collection |

2. Quote-tweet "bad commits" with roaster demo
3. Reply to "how do I learn AI" with beginner-friendly pitch
4. Engage with AI tool builders

### Reddit Strategy

**Target Subreddits:**
| Subreddit | Approach | Content Type |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| r/programming | Philosophy | Anti-framework post |
| r/Python | Technical | Tool tutorials |
| r/MachineLearning | Educational | "How I built X in 100 lines" |

**Post Templates:**

**r/programming:**
```
Title: I'm building AI tools with a hard rule: 100 lines max

I was frustrated with AI frameworks that require 300 lines for simple tasks.

So I started 100LinesOfAICode - powerful tools with an artificial constraint.

The constraint forces:
- No abstraction layers
- Every line must earn its place
- Anyone can read the entire tool in minutes

Current tools: [list with line counts]

The fun part? I built a "commit message roaster" that judges your git history. Mine got a D+.

Would love feedback. What tools should I add next?
```

**r/Python:**
```
Title: Weekend project: AI that writes PR descriptions in 68 lines

Got tired of writing "Fixed stuff" in my PR descriptions.

Built an AI tool that reads your git diff and writes a proper description.

Here's the entire source code: [link]

No frameworks. Just the Anthropic API directly.

Total: 68 lines including error handling.
```

### Hacker News Strategy

**Show HN Post:**
```
Title: Show HN: 100LinesOfAICode – AI tools under 100 lines each

URL: https://github.com/josharsh/100LinesOfAICode

Text:
Hi HN,

I've been building a collection of AI developer tools with a constraint: each must be under 100 lines.

Featured tools:
- Commit Roaster (55 lines) - AI judges your commit messages
- Kind Blame (70 lines) - Git blame but encouraging
- Week Recap (65 lines) - Summarize your week for standup

The philosophy: frameworks like LangChain add layers of abstraction. These tools let you see the entire implementation at once.

Example: My RAG system is 94 lines vs typical 300+ line tutorials.

Looking for feedback on:
1. What tools would you want?
2. Is 100 lines a good constraint?

All MIT licensed. PRs welcome.
```

**Timing:** Post Tuesday-Thursday, 9-10 AM EST

### Dev.to Strategy

**Article Series: "100 Lines of AI"**

1. "I Replaced LangChain with 94 Lines of Python"
2. "How I Built an AI Commit Roaster in 55 Lines"
3. "The Case Against AI Frameworks"
4. "Teaching AI Development Without the Bloat"

**Template:**
- Hook with a problem/controversy
- Show the simple solution
- Explain each section of code
- Call-to-action: Star the repo

### YouTube Strategy

**Video Ideas:**

1. **"Building AI Tools Speed Run"** (5 min)
   - Terminal recording
   - Build a tool from scratch
   - Show it working immediately

2. **"Roasting My Git History with AI"** (3 min)
   - Fun, shareable content
   - Show real (embarrassing) commits
   - End with "try it yourself"

3. **"LangChain vs 100 Lines"** (10 min)
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Same functionality
   - Line count at the end

**Technical Setup:**
- Use `asciinema` for terminal recording
- Convert to GIF for Twitter
- Full video for YouTube

---

## 🤝 Community Building Strategy

### GitHub Engagement

**Issue Templates:**
- "Tool Request" - Let community vote
- "First Good Issue" - Onboard contributors
